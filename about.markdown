Hi!

Welcome to my blog - Developer under pressure.

My name is Ricardo Felgueiras. 
I'm an engineering manager with more than 12 years of experience in developing (mostly) web applications. I've worked in several areas, particularly in education, banking and e-commerce area.

At the moment, I'm working at dashdash where I have the chance to act as a coach and lead a team of engineers with different types of backgrounds and experiences. 

In the last years, I’ve been focused mainly on managing teams by acting as a mentor and a coach. 
 
To me, the recipe for a great team is composed of 3 different ingredients with equal parts: 
- Motivated people - core ingredient to success; 
- Get things done - push things live as in it’s better live than perfect;
- Great technical knowledge - pretty much self-explanatory.

Here, I write about software development. 
I decided to create this blog and start writing mainly to share my experiences and my opinion about software development, his processes and more technical stuff.
